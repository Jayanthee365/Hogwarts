                    <p>Ravenclaws are often hard-working and diligent, as often was the case with intellectuals with a
                        predisposition for academics, some of the pupils sorted under the blue-bronzed eagle were known
                        to be inclined to dismiss certain social expectations for the sake of satisfying their own
                        intellectual curiosity.</p>

            <h2>Rowena Ravenclaw</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Rowena Ravenclaw (fl. c. 993) was a Scottish witch and one of the four founders of Hogwarts School of
                Witchcraft and Wizardry. She was noted for her intelligence and creativity.
                Ravenclaw died sometime in the eleventh century, after she fell fatally ill. Legend had it that a broken
                heart is the cause — because her daughter Helena ran away with her diadem. Rowena's portrait remains at
                Hogwarts.<br></p>
